## Project Title
**AI-Based Intelligent Education System**

## Project Overview
University AI is a next-generation intelligent education platform that uses advanced artificial intelligence to monitor, assess, and enhance student engagement, academic performance, and psychological well-being. The system supports online learning environments by using machine learning models and real-time AI-driven conversations to provide personalized insights and timely support for both students and educators.

This solution is built to address the growing demand for adaptive, scalable, and ethical AI tools in digital education‚Äîempowering institutions to shift from reactive interventions to proactive student success strategies.

## Objectives
- Deliver intelligent academic performance prediction and mental health monitoring.
- Create a voice-interactive, conversational AI agent that students can talk to.
- Support early identification of struggling students through AI-based risk analysis.
- Build a modular, privacy-conscious, and scalable educational AI platform.

## Key Features
- üéì **Smart Performance Prediction**  
  Machine learning models predict academic performance changes using behavioral and psychological indicators.

- üß† **AI-Powered Behavioral Analysis**  
  Identifies patterns in student stress, anxiety, screen time, and more‚Äîenabling data-backed decision making.

- üó£Ô∏è **Conversational AI Agent**  
  A voice-interactive AI agent built using **ElevenLabs** (text-to-speech) and **ChatGPT-4 (OpenAI)** for intelligent, human-like responses. Students can ask questions, get explanations, or discuss study challenges via natural language.

- üîê **Secure API Integration**  
  The ElevenLabs voice engine is connected via API key and securely integrated into the platform. All AI queries are routed to ChatGPT-4 using OpenAI‚Äôs secure endpoints.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Multi-Model ML Engine**  
  Implements multiple ML classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, etc.) for robust performance analysis.

- üí¨ **Explainable AI (XAI)**  
  Provides model insights and reasoning behind predictions for transparency and trust.

## System Architecture
1. **Input & Voice Layer**  
   Users interact via voice using ElevenLabs text-to-speech, converted to prompts for ChatGPT-4 via API.

2. **ML Prediction Layer**  
   Local models evaluate risk of academic performance change based on behavioral data.

3. **Response & Explanation Engine**  
   AI responses generated by ChatGPT-4 are returned in real-time, while model predictions inform interventions.

4. **Feedback Loop**  
   Human feedback and outcome monitoring enable model retraining and continuous learning.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning)
- **Matplotlib** (Visualization)
- **OpenAI GPT-4 API** (Conversational intelligence)
- **ElevenLabs API** (Voice interface)
- **FPDF** (Report generation)
- **Jupyter Notebook / Colab** (Development environment)

## Applications
- **Academic Counseling**: Informs advisors about students at academic risk.
- **Student Support Chatbot**: Students can verbally interact with the AI to ask questions or express concerns.
- **Mental Wellness Awareness**: Encourages proactive student self-awareness via conversational interaction.
- **Institutional Planning**: Offers insights into patterns across the student body.

## Future Scope
- Integration into campus apps, LMS platforms, or virtual assistants.
- Real-time dashboards for faculty.
- Voice-based accessibility features for differently abled students.
- Expansion to multilingual and cross-institutional deployments.
